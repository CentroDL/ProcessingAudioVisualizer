This is the second peer assessment assigment for Coursera.org's Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile Apps Course by the University of London.

I pulled the audio from here: http://www.freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/218866/

Basic parameterization based on audio power, changing the color, amount of iterations on each for loop, and direction of the movement. 

Some additional effects like strokeweight, global rotation and scaling are commented out but you are free to uncomment and see as you wish.
